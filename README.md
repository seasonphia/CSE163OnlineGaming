<b>Research Questions</b>

1. What degree of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) does gaming have on work for
people who play online games for more than 20 hours a week?
2. How does being a student at college/university or being an individual who is
unemployed/between jobs affect the hours of online games an individual plays?
3. How likely is it that individuals who game more than 20 hours a week score a 4 or 5 on
the narcissism scale?

<b>Motivation and background</b>

As technology becomes more prevalent in our lives, the mental health implications and
consequences of increased screen time usage and virtual presence should also be addressed. We
decided to focus on online gaming in relation to life satisfaction, anxiety and social phobias as
we see these as pretty big issues that have gone largely unaddressed. Anxiety is the most
common mental health disorder no matter what demographic, geographic location or
environmental impacts (Davis Behavioral Health, 2020). Therefore, we wanted to see how
screen time usage -- especially in relation to online gaming -- is correlated with anxiety and
social phobia. We are trying to find whether it is “not difficult”, “somewhat difficult” or “very
difficult” for people who play online games more than 20 hours a week to concentrate on work
and other responsibilities. This is to try and find a correlation between the amount of time spent
playing online games and whether individuals exhibit symptoms of GAD.

Further, a lot of research has shown that individuals in the Millennial and Generation Z
generational demographics have the worst overall mental health. We want to compute whether a
younger age of being a “student at college/university” or being “unemployed/between jobs”
leads to more time spent gaming across all platforms and how this has impacted and is associated
with mental health disorders. We think it would be really interesting to draw associations
between the age of an individual and their student/employment status and see if there is a
significant connection.

In addition, we think it is important to find what factors affect people with gaming
addictions. Multiple studies have shown that narcissistic individuals are more likely to become
addicted to online games due to reward center stimulation in the brain and resolving self-esteem
issues (The Gaming Gazette, 2015). Therefore, we want to draw a correlation between
Narcissistic Personality Disorder and hours an individual spends on gaming. It would be
interesting to find if there is some sort of relationship between Narcissistic Personality Disorder, gaming addiction as well as other mental health disorders such as anxiety and social phobia.

Drawing these correlations and associations between online gaming and mental health
disorders can be useful in raising awareness that online gaming addiction is actually a very
pressing health concern. By analyzing the online gaming dataset and gaining data insights into
how online gaming affects individuals and their mental health -- specifically with GAD,
Narcissistic Personality Disorder and social phobias -- there could be more research poured into
studying how gaming affects the brain and rewires certain reward centers so we all become more
knowledgeable about the risks of online gaming addiction and so proper and better treatments for
those addicted are implemented.

<b>Dataset</b>

The dataset we are using contains information collected about online gaming anxiety,
specifically gaming in association to GAD, satisfaction with life and social phobia. This dataset
can be <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/online-gaming-anxiety-data'>accessed here</a>. The columns of the Online Gaming Anxiety dataset correlate with each survey question on a
questionnaire that was part of a psychological study.

While the dataset includes general identifying information such as gender, age and
employment status, it also encompasses questions about what game a person plays, gaming
platforms, the amount of time spent gaming weekly, whether there are any earnings or streaming
for the games, and the reasons an individual plays the game. These are all categories that factor
into anxiety, satisfaction with life and social phobia. The psychological study therefore also
asked and received informative answers on questions involving the gaming individual’s level of
anxiety, satisfaction with life and degree of social phobia.
